# HLT_Coursework
This repository contains the project for the course Human Language Technology. The primary objective of this project is to address the sentiment analysis task using pretrained Large Language Models, such as BERT, with a focus on fine-tuning the model not only for parameter efficiency but also for data efficiency.

In order to enhance model tuning efficiency, we have primarily delved into the realm of continuous prompts methods. More specifically, we have experimented with two types of prompt tuning: basic prompt tuning and prefix prompting tuning. To further enhance performance in a low-data setting, we have integrated deep metric learning with the prompt methods.
